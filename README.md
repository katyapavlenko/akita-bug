Reproduction for https://github.com/datorama/akita/issues/446#issuecomment-643781520

Try running `npm run build` and open index.html in browser

Then try `npm run build:prod` and do the same

You'd see that in prod build navigation between pages would cause error in console

If `@datorama/akita-ng-router-store` would be downgraded to 5.0.0, the problem would pass
